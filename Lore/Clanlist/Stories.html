class="s8" dir="ltr">Since it interests some people I&#39;ll tell a longer history of [T] with more of a Euro perspective, and I hope you don&#39;t mind if I include some [TCN] stories too, as they usually go down well. <br><br>I befriended a young US targeter called Firerunner. Eventually we decided to make our own clan and call it [FBF]ForgedByFire. Some guys complained that we stole their tag and wanted to war us for the rights to it. Once they realised how good FIRERUNNER was they said we could keep it, but we let them have it instead, and I came up with the [T] tag.<br><br>We recruited rapidly, basically trying to recruit anyone who could beat us. FIRERUNNER grabbed a guy called Souljah who was a good all round player. [DEA] made a few attempts to recruit FIRERUNNER iirc, backtracking on their earlier cheat accusations against him. But like me, he disliked the monopoly DEA had on the game. I wasn&#39;t having much luck recruiting as everyone I tried to recruit was holding out for a slot in DEA. e.g., I tried to recruit Darkiuxx, but he joined DEA instead. Then one day I played against a guy called GodExMachina in Silo who was pretty amazing with Plasma. I thought he was an alias for [BK]Auselan who was also good with plasma. But when I kept seeing this GodEx ([T]AlCapone) guy owning all the time even with other weapons, and noticed that he kept pretty quiet and cool, I thought I&#39;d try and recruit him. I was surprised and excited when he said yes straight away.<br><br>People wanted to join [T] when they saw how good FIRERUNNER was. I think he got two other players: Orangeblood and Born2Snipe, who were pretty decent riflers, although I never played them much. OrangeBlood came back a year or two ago because I remember playing a few maps with him. I&#39;ve played Born2Snipe about 18 months ago too. I even saw some guy from FIRERUNNER&#39;s old clan [DXA] in A51 about 6 months ago: &#39;Azzkicker&#39;. He couldn&#39;t believe it when I remembered him from a decade ago. We also recruited a friend of FIRERUNNER&#39;s first clan leader (MajorKickAss) called Nomad, who was an interesting person to talk to on MSN.<br><br>As I could no longer play at night, I continued to play in [TCN] UK server. My main rivals in Euro were JonnyBravo[TCN] and Marvin[TCN] (two scottish twins). Also their older brother Dexter[TCN]. They indoctrinated their children and nephews to believe that I was a shottime user. Consequently Goku[TCN] (Dexter&#39;s son) and Bev[TCN] his cousin also hated me. Every time I killed them they would say &#39;bs m8&#39;. But I would ignore them and they hated that. Some of their insults included &#39;botty&#39; and &#39;wank glove&#39;. Dexter still used the AllAugs on and off bind. They did not understand the concept of bio management. JB accused me of &#39;flicking my augs on and off like a set of Christmas lights&#39;. They kept typing and typing, trying to elicit a response, but back in those days I was always very cool and calm. You will even see that noted in Messiah&#39;s DXMP book. Believe it or not, I never used to act like a dick to anyone - unlike now of course.<br><br>TCN usually only ever recruited the young and naive because they were more impressionable and easy to indoctrinate. But one recruit MagicMan[TCN] got better a lot quicker than they expected him to. He was a 16 year old Finnish kid who was to become infamous. He too was indoctrinated to hate my guts and call me a cheater, although in the end he saw through the bullshit. MagicMan could actually give JB and Marvin a challenge, and they didn&#39;t like this. They wanted all their members to be subordinate and controllable. MagicMan would not stand for this and started to answer back to them. So JB had him kicked from the clan for supposedly using shottime in a 1 vs 1. When they kicked him he leaked all the information from their private forums. They used to keep a tactical file on players they hated. Mine was: Shades - &#39;possible shottime user, game goes to shit if you use plasma on him&#39;. The latter was actually true as for some reason plasma made my fps go down to about 2 on that shitty TNT2 card.<br><br>Magicman - by then using the alias [3]Messiah - decided to push TCN to the extreme. He posted pictures of TCN members in compromising poses by editing the original photos he downloaded from the photo album on TCNs website. He superimposed Dexter&#39;s young daughter Hezza[TCN] on a big breasted woman&#39;s body. He also found a photo of Dexter in a dance pose and cropped a picture of a goat over Dexter&#39;s pelvic region so it looked like he was thrusting the goat up the backside. JB, outraged by this, decided to give Tuomas a call in Finland. He informed him that they were catching a ferry over, equipped with baseball bats. [3]Messiah was now their sworn enemy. He wanted me to join his newly formed clan so we could defeat the likes of [TCN] and [DEA], but my loyalty was with [T].<br><br>A few months later, when my GCSEs were done with, I came back and the Euro servers were pretty dead. TCN had permabanned Messiah and his brother DBL iirc. I decided to start recruiting for [T] again so we could challenge the likes of [DEA] and a now strong [3]. I also observed how strong [3] were using vision aug. They had mastered the speed, vision, rifle style like no one had before. Most of the US players were more in to throwing knives and cloak ninja style. Also the likes of [W]Kazanski and [3]Kale had discovered how to make fast melee snipe binds in the ini. As a targeting user I could no longer cope with the sudden increase in sniper usage. Sniper was now a primary weapon that everyone used, so I decided to stop using targeting. I started speed tanking but really trying to limit the amount that I used speed aug. I made a rule where I&#39;d only allow myself to use speed aug to dodge lams. It actually worked quite well and I forgot why I stopped trying to develop that style. Around that time I recruited a French tanker called TITANK who was improving at a quick rate.<br><br>After even more months of inactivity, I made another come back and finally managed to get a new dedicated 128mb ASUS A7V8X graphics card too. I was also pleased to get hold of one of the best players this game has seen who most people know as [I]Trauma. He was banned from [DEA] when I managed to persuade him to leave their clan for [T]. Everyone warned me that he would leave straight away because he was a serial multiclanner/name changer, but I ignored their warnings. This started off a lot of shit talk with [DEA]. They realised that [T] was now a threat to them because we had one of DXs best players. TonyMontana claimed that before that he had never even heard of us, and tried to downplay our threat. I must admit that at that time I was getting pretty arrogant and my persona changed.<br><br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">If anyone wants me to continue I&#39;ll post another instalment later. <br><br>(In reply to thread comments) Ok I&#39;ll open another topic for it and write some more later. Well Messiah got some photos from TCNs website of Dexter and Hezza (the daughter) and he shopped them in funny poses. In fact I don&#39;t think he made Hezza fucking a goat, he put her on a naked body with boobs. Dexter was kind of in a dance pose with his fist out, so Messiah put a goat around his pelvic area and it looked like he was thrusting the goat. He just cut the pictures out and put them against bright backgrounds with patterns. <br><br>Ok well I have to get off the comp for a couple hours but I&#39;ll add more as soon as I can. Yea Hezza was the only one that didn&#39;t chat shit tbh. It probably was her, yea. Dexter was in his 40s. I spoke to him a few times on MSN and he wasn&#39;t too bad a guy really, just a bit annoying in game. Goku used to be pretty mouthy although he did seem to mellow down a bit in the end. Apparently he was shit talking Duke a couple months ago so he had a 1 vs 1 and Duke won, but tbh I wonder if it was someone impersonating him. I saw a guy called Dexter the other week but with a slightly higher ping than I&#39;d have expected (80). When I asked if it was him he made no reply, which is a bit suspicious. I&#39;d like to think it was him. <br><br>I remember Verbluten. Wasn&#39;t he more of a 0-aug Euro? Never knew that about CannonFodder.<br><br>Messiah commented: &quot;Shades&#39; depiction on how things went down with TCN is surprisingly accurate but I was never intentionally mean to Hezza. She was always kind towards me and I never saw a reason to mix her up with my feud with her ill-tempered uncles/father. However, during one of TCN&#39;s anti-messiah campaigns on their forum, one of the brothers edited an image of my little sister into something distasteful and posted it. In retaliation to that I photoshopped Hezza&#39;s photo. And if I remember correctly, the TCN brothers then deleted their post and made me look like I had done it first.&quot;<br><br></span>Getting back to my own account: I thought [T] was on the ascendancy when we recruited Trauma, but Souljah started to make joke tags like [DWIP] (something to do with insect porn). He also tried to persuade us into coming into servers to teamkill with him. When Trauma told him to stop Souljah accused him of being gay etc etc and they fell out. In the meantime he had recruited a few members but my memory is hazy over exactly who: TeamMossad and Kago, I think. Trauma also used a new alias every game so that people such as Messiah would contact me on MSN asking who our new players were. Everyone thought we had an army of good players, when in reality they were all Trauma under alias; and in reality we still had very few active members; and those that were active usually spent most of the time teamkilling.<br><br>I also took a chance on recruiting a kid called Will, which probably didn&#39;t add to our reputation. Even though everyone hated Will and mocked him, I found him to be kind of likeable - if a bit annoying - and so decided to stick up for the underdog. Some examples of the gay things he used to do though include: going in [DEA] server with dynamic IP and using &#39;reloadcount 0&#39; to throw multiple lams around the server until it lagged out. At the time [DEA] could find no real way to stop him - I can&#39;t even remember if MTL existed then - so he was like a little terrorist. Another time, he made a webcam video mimicking [I]Hitokiri, in which he mocked Hitokiri&#39;s ghetto Azn demeanor. In the video Will was topless, waving his fingers around, and wearing a cap saying: &quot;Yoyoyo, gangster yo, I&#39;m Hito and I&#39;ll bust a cap in yo&#39; ass.&quot; To be fair, I think this was in response to some [I]mmortal members leaving calls on Will&#39;s family home answering machine - probably saying something about his mother - but I can&#39;t remember.<br><br>Back in Europe [TCN] had become extremely paranoid, probably after getting owned multiple times by Triads and US players with now cheap broadband. I remember the adminning was some of the most appalling it is possible to imagine. Marvin banned me once when he tried to sneak up on me cloaked in a spawn room while I was getting EMPs. I had vision and killed him by surprise. Now granted we hadn&#39;t even just spawned, he still banned me anyway for &#39;spawnkilling&#39;. JB would even ban you from his server if you upset him in another server. A game I really wish I had demorec&#39;d was when JB was owned in a nameless French server by a complete newb. JB came in and died a few times to GEP from some &#39;Player&#39; alias, and then the player started to cloak. I myself was aliasing and decided to spectate and watch the fireworks. After only a short time JB started to get really angry because he couldn&#39;t find the guy. After his usual &#39;bs mate&#39; he started to say &#39;you are an absolute disgrace m8&#39; (all because he was killed by gep a few times). He then said he was going to get the IP of the host and ban him from [TCN]. This is the kind of shit Euros had to put up with in those days.<br><span style="font-style:italic;"><br>OK I feel as if I&#39;m running out of interesting things to say at the moment so I&#39;ll think of more tonight, and talk a bit more about how the styles of play developed.... <br><br>(debating the survival of clans with jEj)<br>jEj (Jan 21 2012): &quot;Yeah, but you or Firerunner didn&#39;t quit&quot;<br><br></span>Firerunner and I did virtually quit, but we were just thoughtful enough not to do the old &#39;DX is dying, I quit thread&#39; that most other attention-whores used to break up their clans. Instead we decided to carry on in a ghost role, so others could carry on if they wanted to, and so we could maybe come back one day. I suggest other clan leaders do what we did; and wait and see how the clan turns out in your absence. Imo it is kinda egotistical to just close a clan and not let any of the remaining elders carry it on; that is, unless of course, you strongly suspect they are nubs who are going to turn out to act gay and ruin the legacy of the clan.<br><br>In our absence [T] managed to maintain a cult following just enough to keep it alive. Firerunner had made some good recruits in the past that came back from time to time and gave the clan a bit of a legacy. Unfortunately, [T] was also known for another legacy because of a small contingent of hangers on, who enjoyed aliasing and teamkilling. It got to the point where I didn&#39;t like the direction the clan was taking, but since I&#39;d already gave up my responsibilities and relinquished control of the clan by then, it would&#39;ve been unfair of me to start dictating how I wanted it run. That said, I left [T] officially for [I]. Firerunner wasn&#39;t too happy when he found out, but I think he understood.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite its lack of any substantial backing e.g., a dedicated fast server, scheduled clan wars, forums, or active members, it managed to go a long way. Edit for clarity: We didn&#39;t have all this when I was active, but later on when I&#39;d already left [T]AlCapone provided all this. It probably helped that we had always promoted the idea of no central leadership. It is just a shame that the cheesy name &#39;Transcend&#39; also seemed to attract a certain contingent of players who seemed to join more as a joke than anything else. Sadly, they were the same ones prone to suicide gepping, teamkilling, and multiple aliases. When I left I expected [T] would just fade into obscurity, but [T]AlCapone (Russ/GodEx) did a good job of turning the clan around and giving it a second lease of life. For a while they became pretty competitive again, but that is a story someone like Jej could probably tell better.<br><br>And Russ played DXMP much less actively /../, yet still managed to keep a clan going /../. Also, Russ wasn&#39;t around at the times you probably think he was - and was probably our most inactive member before I quit. He became his most active after Firerunner and I had already left in an official capacity for other clans. I&#39;m not trying to call him out because he was a good guy and I know he had a lot of passion for [T]; the same passion that I wish I still had. But the truth remains that he had to come back from months at a time of inactivity to resurrect a - for most intents and purposes - already dead at the time [T]. I think maybe Kingpin and a few suicide gep newbs using multiple aliases still kept it running. And if I&#39;d wanted to be super-gay, I could&#39;ve asked Firerunner (who still hadn&#39;t left for [BK] yet iirc), to claim ownership of the clan and stop Russ when he came back to resurrect the tag a couple of months later.<br><br>The fact that [T] managed to make a comeback under the guidance of [T]AlCapone; with only one or two of the original members, and the fact that it managed to redeem a tarnished reputation of being so full of aliases, teamkillers and aimbotters, is testament to the fact that [A!B] has as much, if not more, of a chance at survival than [T] because even we don&#39;t act as gay as the levels [T] reached at some points. Even if our reputation hasn&#39;t been perfect, and even if no one does take us seriously, history is on our side. We currently have 4 or 5 members who have played this game for a long time, and will likely be here until the end.<br><br><br>(on MTL getting decompiled, and when T was formed) And yea I think it was Brina, with Mimi being the alias she used in game. Just read that long post on [A] forums by Mono. Brings back some memories although I can&#39;t really remember [CYD] and [Y] so obviously I&#39;m not that old school. I remember getting owned by members of [EIS], [DMI], and obviously [DEA]. I&#39;m also certain I installed the game when the 1112fm patch was already out. So I guess I was only around since 2001, but I can&#39;t remember if [T] formed within months of me installing the game, or the next year in 2002. Edit to add: think I&#39;ve probably been around since early 2000 now that I come to think of it, so [T] probably did form some time in 2001. <br><br><br>(joining [3]Kale&#39;s recollection found below) I remember all those names you mentioned, but I only remember Kaiser when he was in [BK]? I was either not playing or only just starting out when [Y] was around. Forgot about Coolhand - a great player. Also ChemicalAgent was another rifler I couldn&#39;t touch.<br><br>I didn&#39;t play Locke either, but I think the stories about him playing with no augs are just meant as a joke. I played against one of Beast&#39;s alleged aliases - LastCupOfSorrow - many years after he retired. He played ok with knives, but not extraordinary. To be fair, I guess he needed time to relearn the game for us to really judge how good of a player he was. <br><br>Looking at Smuggler&#39;s old Fortune City site he announced a beta version in September 2002 so you can assume at least some public servers started using it either before that in mid 2002, as you say, or some time after it was announced. So some time between mid and late 2002. I&#39;m weirded out that it really was that early - it seemed ages waiting for a cheat-mod at the time.<br><br>(on tRauma) I think calling him a newb-owner is harsh on him as I regularly saw him getting unbelievable scores in servers full of veterans and - assuming he wasn&#39;t cheating - the [DEA] vs [I] war is testament to that. But you&#39;re right: when you managed to pin him down to a straight melee his aim actually wasn&#39;t as god-like as you&#39;d expect for someone of his quality. Even so, aim isn&#39;t everything in this game and he still had an uncanny ability for staying alive. Maybe, as you say, he did use some subtle bio-hax to help him with this; but I didn&#39;t notice anything like that in the demos (now lost) that I watched. What I did notice is that the guy was a slippery bastard: half the time he&#39;d be fighting with red health and yet playing as if he still had full health and bio. Somehow he knew how to dodge and cloak in order to outlast his opponent, even when things were stacked against him. Imo he is still the best player I ever played.<br><br>(on tRauma) I must admit that it made me question things in the back of my mind when his retirement seemed to coincide with the introduction of MTL. But I&#39;d still rather assume he had other reasons for quitting. He was telling me his sister made him feel uneasy about being on the computer so much, and he was fed up of getting hated on and teamkilled in the game. He did have a contingent of players who would go in the game just to tk him. Also some don&#39;t realise that he was only 15 or 16 when he quit iirc, so maybe school was another reason. <br><br><br>You&#39;re spot on there. Amigo was doing it before anyone else and was one of the best at it. He did come back to play some maps in Euro servers a few months ago, but at some point his attitude must&#39;ve changed as he wasn&#39;t the player I remember. Rather than using his usual style, he was mimicking the cloak-shell style of [DEA], and singing their praises as the best clan ever. He also wasn&#39;t playing too greatly, although I guess he was rusty. Not really sure if it was an impersonator, but it was random enough - to claim to be a HE20mm wielding Amigo - that I think it was actually him. Whoever it was, the guy did still manage to streak-break me a few times with rifle. <br><br><br>(on firerunner) I think he decided targeting was holding him back in the end. At some point he switched to cloak-ballistic instead. He was always using his new style by the time he joined [BK] and Apostle possibly encouraged him to do this. He was good with it, but not as amazing as with targeting. If he&#39;d kept at it I&#39;m sure he would&#39;ve mastered that style as well. Even if he did abandon targeting in the end, he still proved that it is lethal when done right. <br><br><br><br>(on hitokiri) His play was indeed very similar to Trauma, and in fact, that style seemed to become a hallmark for most of the [I]mmortals. Also, I know what you&#39;re saying; he did do a lot of running, and his style was kinda annoying. Even so, I&#39;d still say he was an outstanding player. Hito could go missing half the map by just patiently waiting for his 3 streak; and like a predator, he would seek out the weakest opponents in the map and cut off access to bio and med bots. If you were low on bio and meds in a server, you could be sure that Hito was nearby somewhere - probably watching and waiting.<br><br>I used to 1 vs 1 him frequently and it was actually worse to get the first kill on him because he&#39;d run back and stalk you down while you were still too low on bio from the last fight. And all of a sudden, he&#39;d be the one streaked and out of sight. It was almost like he did it deliberately. He was better than me at actually hiding and staying out of sight long enough to get meds and cells once he had a streak, so usually he would win. On some occasions I did manage to get myself into a comfortable position with a few meds and cells so it was harder for him to put pressure on me and stalk me, but then he would still make it nerve-wracking by sitting back and tossing lams - another thing he was good at. In general, he rarely suffered from bad scores because of his patience and once he had that streak he was intelligent enough to keep the momentum going and rack up high scores. Although I don&#39;t think he was as good as Trauma, he was certainly a great player who was underestimated by many just because his style was a bit &#39;gay&#39;. <br><br><br>---</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R6" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">7</div></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R7" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">8</div></th><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">[3]Ste</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">Was a veteran of DXMP, long time player    (<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#ffffff;"><a target="_blank" href="http://thc.b1.jcink.com/index.php?showtopic=833">source</a></span>)     On [CYD], [DK], [TCN], [3] &amp; Messiah</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s7" dir="ltr"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R8" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">9</div></th><td></td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="s11" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 190px"><th id="677234030R9" style="height: 190px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 190px">10</div></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">Unsure if this is a good read but I&#39;ll write one of the things that happened to me personally:<br><br>I started out in the clan [CYD] which stood for consider yourself dead.

Sadly, he was good friends with Jaster (Will was as well, I ran into Will and Jaster playing a game called Tactical Ops) who was an ass and a fat high school drop out, but when Jaster got his Pentium 4 Northwood he became an amazing DX rifler (I hate to admit this), though this was late 2003(?) era and therefore meaningless.<br><br>People that don&#39;t get enough credit: Pre-DMI era (I spent most of this time gepping on skyline [or was it hell&#39;s kitchen?, lots of weird early maps], sadly I never got to play Beast or Locke, Locke apparently never had to use augs at all to win and beast limited himself to like 3 or 4 augs max): [Y]Kaiser was awesome back in the day and was great for years. Coolhands was one of the earliest US riflers and he stuck with it for years and was always pro. DMI era: [EIS]2Jiggy4u, this guy was a dedicated sawed-off shotty player and he was good at it! I liked [N/A]AleX. I remember thinking Virtualbullsae and vainglory were amazing, and TonyMontana was a solid player. BK-era: As much as I like Kaz, to mention Kazanski&#39;s sniper rifle without mentioning AMIGO is blasphemy, as far as I&#39;m concerned amigo is the father of melee sniping and he was also a prototype for modern day speed rifling style with cloak. Between Messiah and Amigo I think that the modern rifle game was established (though they did not invent the styles, the styles were around in 2000[?] when I started so I couldn&#39;t say who did), they were notable players to me that represent the modern era, with smart binds and bio management and a commanding presence (though mess was very whiney). Apostle was a good player, no one mentions him anymore.<br><br>Firerunner was pro with targeting, for sure, but I don&#39;t think he was a game changer. Every month that passed targeting became more irrelevant, by 2003 it was fringe.

Then in very late 2002/early 03 he became a top class rifler, but his play was very much like trauma. Melkor told me he considered hito the best player in the game at one point, but I never agreed since I thought hito was a turret-camper who spent most of his games running from fights so he could shell non-streakers. The game was very different back in the day when 7v7 and 8v8 was the norm on BigCountry&#39;s servers, you could spend the whole game hiding a streak since you had lots of teammates to run to. His friendship with system would make it not surprising if he did cheat, he had one or two amazing kills on me when I underestimated him. <br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">haha I just remembered a player named GEPGunUpTheBum from early 2001, prototype version of fukhead<br><br>Shades commented: &quot;Yea I remember him.

I actually think JohnnyBravo gave me the most challenge as when I played him, I was still relatively new to this game and very nervous about the match. Around that time he was considered a very good player and had kind of a &quot;fan cult&quot; built around him. The game barely got started though because after JB got 2-0 streak, I was able to take him down and when having 3-2 myself, the match turned into a debate about cheats. I was less nervous about the other matches as I had much more experience and had simply improved a lot as a player. Overall 1 vs. 1 are not the best way to define how good a player is anyway since it is a lot about getting the first streak. Back then people had slower connections and computers so you did not see anyone do super quick kills like you see today so it was harder to bring down a streaked player. It is a lot different to play with 50 ping and 200 fps than 250 ping and 20 fps<br><br>What comes to clan matches, the toughest one for me was the match with [DEA]. That was a clan match that really meant something and I had repeatedly tried to challenge them for months. It was a match that everyone wanted to see happen because [3] had made its way to the top and [DEA] claimed to be the best despite the fact that they almost never accepted any challenges. Throughout my career I always loved playing &quot;legendary&quot; players/clans because I wanted the challenge and also to prove the legends wrong. [DEA] was a perfect example of an urban legend - they earned their reputation early on when people on average were not very good. They then maintained it with their server and by simply refusing to fight other clans. I never really understood that because I thought clan matches were the best part of the game and I just wanted to do as many as I could. Therefore I never refused an official challenge, no matter who it was from (except for known cheaters or so).<br><br>When [DEA] finally accepted our challenge and laid all their terms in &quot;take it or leave it&quot; style, I over-confidently thought we could beat them no matter what. I was nervous that day because I had stopped actively playing the game and it backfired big time. [3] always relied heavily on my game play in official matches and I played the worst I ever had in an official match. Blame it on being rusty, the ping, having simply one of those bad gaming days or whatever but nothing seemed to work. And when you notice that you can not do the same damage as you usually do, you start to get frustrated and play even worse. Most of our members under-performed that day except for Khomeini who was one of the few of our members to actively still play DXMP. I believe around that time he had become one of the best players around and known for his sniping.<br><br>Outside my time with [3], I played 1-2 matches as MagicMan for [TCN] against [DK] and [DEV]. I do not remember much from those matches except that I was still using the classic tanker style and did not perform very well. I also remember being super annoyed when I missed a match with [R] because I overslept. It was one of the legendary older clans and had respected veterans such as SilentAssassin, ICE and ANCESTOR.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">Blade (May 4 2020): &quot;You played up to 2006 mainly, PCs/internet connections developed a lot during that time, would you say the skill level of the top players was higher, lower or about the same - as these things changed? Or was it continually dropping as more and more of the older players just stopped playing?&quot;</span><br><br>This is a hard question to answer because I have not really played anyone else than you, &quot;psycho&quot; and an aliased player in 2020. Back in the day you had several servers full of people and each played with a different style. The matches were team based and you could rely on your team mates instead of having to constantly watch your back in a death match. It is a fact that some things that happen today would have not been possible back in the day. The notably higher FPS and internet speed seem to have made it possible to do super quick kills. But I think people today know more about key binds etc.<br><br>I think I played my last games around 2006 when we held the final DXMP marathons. Around that time the average skill level had already gotten lower because so many veterans left the game. You need challenge to evolve. The only players I remember getting better around that time were Ricci and ZigZag, I do not know how long they kept playing for after. ZigZag had possibly the best ping I had ever seen back then and was able to do quick kills in similar fashion to what people do now but when he was thrown into an European server, he just bombed.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">Blade: &quot;Not to be negative - I&#39;m more curious than anything - do you have any regrets from your time playing DXMP? idk maybe falling out with someone, or doing more to help beginnners, etc. (just saying for example, i know you did plenty by sharing demos and your book etc.)</span><br><br>Yes I have a few regrets with the main ones being:<br>1) I could have participated less in flame wars although in my defence I was young and did that partly because people flamed me for simply playing better. Like with JohnnyBravo and [TCN], I was very kind to them until they banned me from their server after our 1 vs. 1, made a topic on the [DEA] forums to try to get me banned on other servers also and harassed my clan members for just being my friends. All in all, I wish nobody took my flaming to heart and if anyone did, I am sorry for that.<br><br>2) I would write the &#39;DXMP Book&#39; better and from a less personal perspective. I saw some quite harsh feedback from people and some seemed to fail to understand that I wrote it because I absolutely loved this game. When I was 14, on one week I slept only 12 hours altogether because I stayed all up nights playing on US servers where all the &quot;legends&quot; played. I got several warnings in school because my grades fell so much due to DXMP. The book was written by a young guy in two weeks in a foreign language and from his perspective. Although everything in it is true, for example the player ranking is not based on scientific facts, they were based on my experience. Perhaps mostly I wrote it to preserve my memories of the game, save some of DXMP&#39;s history and to help newcomers learn things faster. I would fix some of the stuff and perhaps I would not be compared to &#39;Hitler&#39;, preferably another less notable serial murderer.<br><br>3) I should have demanded fairer terms for our match with [DEA]. I should have not accepted that they get to choose the date, all maps etc. but most importantly, I should have refused the last minute change to a worse server due to &quot;sudden technical difficulties&quot;. I should have known better not to accept 200-300 ping for some of our European key players including myself. Like Melkor[DEA] said, they caught us at our worst and I thought we could still beat them. And that cost us to lose a match that we should have absolutely dominated.<br><br>4) I could have organised even more clan matches and/or marathons which might have gathered more players around. I do not know if I could have done more to help new players as I did try to share tactics, demorecs and also created [g3] to train newcomers.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">Blade: &quot;Is there any part of the Aug-game that you don&#39;t like? I vaguely recall you mentioning your dislike of the LAW weapon in your book - or anything you&#39;d change that could&#39;ve made the game better?&quot;</span><br><br>I did not hate the LAW rocket itself but it was used to only ruin someone&#39;s game. People obtained it just to suicide LAW you and I considered that poor sportsmanship. Just like suicide GEP, I would have removed the possibility to suicide-kill someone because people used it only to piss you off.<br><br>I guess there are many things that could have been adjusted to be better. The biggest shame is that the MP version was not included in the first release of DX, we would have had a lot more players otherwise. Some of the augmentations were less beneficial compared to others. Radar transparency was for example useless compared to Regeneration. There could have some better augmentations available so that different gaming styles would have been more equal.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">Heh, this topic was active in 2012 and I doubt nobody cares anymore but I wanted to fix this one part just in case anyone happens to read this in the future.<br><br>Shades&#39; depiction on how things went down with TCN is surprisingly accurate but I was never intentionally mean to Hezza. She was always kind towards me and I never saw a reason to mix her up with my feud with her ill-tempered uncles/father. However, during one of TCN&#39;s anti-messiah campaigns on their forum, one of the brothers edited an image of my little sister into something distasteful and posted it. In retaliation to that I photoshopped Hezza&#39;s photo.

I can certainly say he was a dirty fighter and an opportunist. As far as Targeting goes, everyone used to think that aug was crazy since mathematically it did less damage (even though that aug was supposed to counter BP, it actually didnt). But I made it work. When asked about using it and how easily I could be damaged, I simply replied: &quot;Don&#39;t get shot.&quot;<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">(pointed at monoxide story, also here right below)<br></span>Cool story, mono.

I saw a couple threads with people talking about their DX memories, here is my contribution, minus all the shite that happened in my personal life during that time. Feel free to fill in the gaps, or correct any mistakes I have made. Please do not remind me how much of an asshole I was at times, I am well aware of it. <br><br></span>Somewhere around March of 2001, I was browsing random websites on my spankin new DSL connection. I happened to come across information regarding a patch for Deus Ex which allowed multiplayer. I had already been playing Quake 3 a bit online, and thouroughly enjoyed it. I decided to give Deus Ex a shot. I think I spent a good 10 minutes looking at the &quot;name&quot; box, trying to come up with a good online handle. No, I was never guilty of &quot;player&quot;. Don&#39;t ask me how, or why, but I chose cd_spacemonkey (cd being my first and middle initials, and spacemonkey for reasons unknown). I&#39;m not sure which server I joined, as I recall it was an area51 only server. I immediately picked up a sniper rifle and proceeded to camp the shadowed area next to the hanger. I thought I had the perfect setup, then suddenly I was dead. The assailent was nowhere to be found. My screen was moving around and I could hear sounds, but I saw nothing. I had never bothered to use the cloak aug in DXSP, it had completely escaped my mind.<br><br>I remember seeing people with crazy letters around their names, I had not yet been hipped to the clan thing. It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that most people with clan tags were pretty good, and the guys with [DEA] on their name were to be avoided at all costs. [Y] (god damn that plasma rifle), [CYD], [GDX], and a few others were active at the time. Apoc was the first DEA I saw. He was absolutely amazing. I&#39;d see him kill one person after the next with ease. Eventually I started to see others, I think I caught a glimpse of BigCountry and Drama a time or two, both of them were equally amazing as far as I was concerned. I drew the conclusion from seeing these three play that all of DEA must have a similar style; the three of them were so different than anybody else at the time, but all so similar to eachother. Of course I later realized that Drama was a vision knifer, not a cloaker.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">DMI</span><br>Eventually I started associating with a regular crowd in game. I think the first person to remember me when I joined was Rocketman. After that was probably 2Jiggy4u. Jiggy was always quite a bit better than me, but I think Rocketman was about the same level. I joined a game one day and he was sporting a tag, [DMI]. There were a couple others on the server, a was a little jealous. I played with them for a while, and eventually Hitman (not the Aussie) asked if I would like to join the clan. I knew they were a new bunch, but I did not realize until later that they had just been formed that day. Through email conversation with Hitman I learned of the roster he had managed to accumulate in one day: ADOYS, out4blood, Virtualbullzae, SilentSniper, CrimsonDragon, Merlin, Duke, Rocketman. I knew who Rocketman was, but who the hell were these other guys? DMI was to be a democratic clan. There was no leader, and there were no ranks, no seniority. Virtualbullzae was working on a website for the clan, and SilentSniper was hosting a server. I volunteered to help on the website, since I was a *cough* expert (hindsight: total noob). I decided to drop the spacemonkey name, and go with Monoxide, I had a smoking habit at the time so it seemed fitting. The first time I hopped into a server as Monoxide[DMI], I saw Jiggy sporting some [EIS] tag. I told him who I was, and he started laying it into me asking why I joined them, I could join EIS. While giving it some thought, some of my new teammates started joining the server. It quickly turned into an unofficial DMI vs EIS friendly battle. Seems like we were about equal. Afterwards I talked to Jiggy on MSN, and he admitted that DMI was better than his initial thoughts.<br><br>We spent a lot of time in our own private server. For the most part we would cruise around big maps and just chat in game. Out of everybody in the clan I think I talked to Duke and Merlin the most. They lived close to me so we always joked about getting together (Duke and Merlin were/are close friends IRL). I started playing with the shotgun and sniper rifle only. One day Duke challenged me to a 1v1. I could not kill the bastard. He later told me it was because he was using augs, and proceeded to tell me what all of them did. I started using Speed, and Ballistic Protection. Duke, Merlin and I all seemed to be at the same skill level. ADOYS and Hitman were on the east coast, we never seemed to be online at the same time. None of the others ever played on public servers. I thought for sure we were the best in the clan, until the first time I actually had to play against ADOYS. You could unload 5 ammo crates into that dude and he would not die. Over time, other people started to think we were pretty good.<br><br>Arouned August 2001 I was taking a trip to Monterey to see a friend who was doing work out there. My course took me right by Duke&#39;s house, so him, Merlin and I decided to meet up. It was no doubt...awkward. Both of them were entirely different than I had imagined, I&#39;m sure they can say the same about me. This meeting brought the three of us pretty close together. It was almost like a clan within the clan.<br><br>We managed to create a pretty heated rivalry with EIS. Come to find out most of them hated everybody in DMI except for me. Jiggy continued attempting to convince me I needed to join them. We tried to setup a real clan match with EIS, the turnout on both sides was utterly dissapointing. So much that I won&#39;t go into the results of the 3v3 and eventually 2v2 that ensued. It was pretty much even as I recall.<br><br>A young kid going by DreamStation desperately wanted into DMI. His clan had just broken up, for the life of me I can&#39;t remember their name or tag. They were around during Yakuza and CYD times. A big controversy (what? drama in DX? no!!) errupted when some unkown person was seen running around PDX with a plasma rifle that shot at insane speeds. I didn&#39;t believe it until I saw it. DreamStation was talking to me on MSN one day telling me how easy it was for anybody to cheat in DX. He took me and a few DMIs to a private server and showed us the shottime command. He eventually confessed that it was him with the Plasma rifle, and that a lot of people knew about the command. Word got out that it was him, people were not happy. He became an outcast of DX.<br><br>I guess I always had a hardon for DEA. I spent a lot of time on their minimalistic website, wondering if I&#39;d ever be good enough to join them. If you ask me, I will still say Apoc was hands down the best player ever in DX. Even considering others in over the course of time, Messiah was really good, Merlin definitely became one of the best, and he would probably contend that VainGlory was always the best, but nobody ever dominated the game the way Apoc did when there were so many other good players around. Maybe I&#39;m blinded though, ADOYS seemed to be able to get the upper hand on him. Vain apparently always did too, so much that Slicer tried to run him out of the game. I envied Apoc&#39;s style so much I decided to try to adopt it. I started playing as a cloaking speed tank. My skill level seemed to jump through the roof over night.<br><br>One random night at 1AM or so I played against a fellow by the name of ClarkGriswald. There were maybe one or two other noobs on the server, it was pretty much just him and I 1v1. We encountered each other a few more times over the next few days, and seemed to dominate the servers at that time of night. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh my ass off every time I saw his name, thinking of National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation. Eventually I started talking to him on AIM. I thought he was a new player, turns out he had been around as long as I had. He had a different handle for all of his playing styles, and I knew every single one of them, thinking they were all great individual players. The one I had seen him use the most in the past was c()()per. The one others know is TonyMontana. I suggested that he join DMI, in fact I pestered him about it for a few days. He said he was holding out for word from BC on whether or not they would let him into DEA. I guess ol Joe took too long getting back to him, and he decided to join us, which he later took hell for because Joe came to him saying he was fit for DEA. For whatever reason he decided to stick with us, for the remainder of our time as a clan. With ClarkGriswald on the roster, we were no doubt one of the best clans of the time. Through him I was able to start talking to people in DEA. I managed to somewhat befriend BC and slicer.<br><br>My most memorable series of battles in DX came around this time. PDX was the server, Towers was the map. There were DEA, EIS, DMI, and a few freelancers. The general fight seemed to be outside on the ground. I managed to encounter Apoc in the office of the cental building. Words cannot explain the battles we had. It was a mental battle more than anything, both of us cloked with full augs, trying to use sounds and objects in the room to trick each other into uncloaking and firing a HE shell or tossing a lam in some direction, and then occasionally we would both go all out 1v1, only to cloak again and heal up. Eventually he killed me. I got a few quick kills and rushed back in there ASAP, sure enough, he was waiting. We did this at least five times. I don&#39;t know if I managed to kill him once. I asked him about it nearly a year later, he remembered it as well as I did.<br><br>DMI had gotten too good to be true apparently. I guess ADOYS mopped the floor with slicer one too many times. Slicer went on a crusade telling everybody we cheated. I exchanged several emails with him. He made it seem like he believed what I was saying, and dropped the accusations, so I thought. Some guy by the name of recils (w31|2d h4x0|2 letters) approached hitman wanting to join DMI. Nobody had ever heard of him, he said he was old school, we were all far too trusting, and apparently flat out retarded for not noticing his name. We tried him out, he was really good. So we decided to let him in. The joke was on us, it was slicer. All he wanted to do was take a gander through our private forum. He found no dirt, and played the whole thing off to the community as acceptable. Most people seemed to side with him, saying we were far too good, and that we came up too quick as a clan. This, in essence, killed DMI. One by one our members wanted nothing to do with DX.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">R</span><br>All of us wanted to stick together as a group, so we took a stab at Tribes 2. That, is a whole story of its own, which I will not go into. After several months of playing Tribes, Merlin talked me into playing a game of DX. It didn&#39;t take me long to get hooked again. I was still pretty upset about the DMI thing, I felt I would be part of the clan forever. Merlin wanted to start a new clan. I hesitantly agreed with him, and decided to play as SecondHandSmoke for whatever reason. Jadesfire (who I tried, unsuccessfully, to court into joining DMI on more than one occasion) said she wanted to be a part of it, thus, Reactors was born. Jade and Merlin got into it on MSN, I think she quit the clan in a matter of hours. Merlin was on a heavy recruiting spree, I didn&#39;t know any of the people he was letting in. I don&#39;t know if I stayed with the clan more than a day or not, but eventually I decied to go solo again. Merlin built up the roster, and then he left the clan as well. So if you hadn&#39;t heard the story of how [R] became a bastardized clan, there you go.<br><br>I stayed solo for a while. TM was MIA attending to personal stuff, he eventually returned to DX and hinted to me again that he may be joining DEA. I asked him to put a word in for me, thinking there was no way in hell it would happen. Merlin approached me on MSN wanting to start up another clan. He already had a list of people wanting to be a part of it, and asked if I was interested. I told him I didn&#39;t want to be part of any clan except DMI, and wished him luck with it. I honestly thought Immortals would go the same way Reactors went. Some time later, TM told me he got into DEA. It wasn&#39;t very long until I got an email from Joe asking me to join as well. I was in disbelief, as was everybody else the first time I joined a server with the new tag. Merlin was PISSED.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">DEA</span><br>The active DEA roster was BigCountry, ApocolypseNOW, TonyMontana, Monoxide, with slicer playing maybe once a week. TM and I carried over a friendship from DMI. TM, BC and Apoc all shared the same stomping grounds in Jersey. We were a tight group. PDX had been gone for some time, and DX was in desperate need of a quality server. BC had big plans to deliver, and the man came through. He spent a lot of money out of his pocket for a server, simply for the sake of keeping DX alive. I don&#39;t think anybody outside the clan ever realized how much money he spent, judging by their ungreatfullness and constant bickering about the way he chose to let us admin it, nobody cared. The server sparked new life in the game, and many old school people returned. Suddenly our active roster was huge. Paradigmic, Andrew, and Blamer all came around out of nowhere. Everybody in DEA knew Strider. I tried to convince him to join DMI a while back, but he wasn&#39;t willing to give up his GDX tag. I think it was still him and one other member. Eventually he was the only remaining member. It didn&#39;t take much of a vote to get him into the clan. Our roster was solid. In conversations to this day, we all tend to agree that this was the peak, or perhaps the beginning of the tallest plateau of DEA.<br><br>Shortly after BC got the DEA server up, he joined using an alias and did something to piss me off. I logged in and gave him the boot. He was more than a little upset when he reconnected.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">I don&#39;t know how I could have forgotton to mention this. I&#39;m willing to bet that TM holds the record to this day for the number of times anybody has banned themself from a server. I believe he checks in at 3.</span><br><br>The demands of school caught up with Blamer, Para, and Drew. After a few months, we found ourselves in need of another active member. It just so happened that EIS was on the fritz, and most of their members had called it quits. We scooped up Melkor and PM instanly. Our roster remained as strong with them on board. Somewhere in this timeframe, either before or after Melk and PM were brought in, we had a friendly match with DK. The first map of the match was CMD, I was so nervous. I started out 0-10, thanks to [DK]IlluminedOne with her knives and 275 ping from New Zealand. At one point slicer asked on the voice server if I wanted him to replace me. Embarrassed, I said I would correct my ratio, which I managed to pull off. The match ended with DEA on top of the scoreboard, but as I said, it was a friendly match. IlluminedOne and I became quite good friends after that. We went on to play against TCN, which was to be a friendly match as well. Things did not stay that way however. They wanted a rematch on a European server. Something that we were not adverse to, but had no immediate plans to setup. Our main focus at the time was getting ready for Immortals.<br><br>Slicer decided to bring in his long time friend [[face]]. To make a long story short, some problems developed between him and a few members, and he quit the clan. As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is where things started going downhill.<br><br>I was getting pretty into web development at the time, and slicer made it known that he wanted to freshen up the DEA site, which was hosted on a gamespy server. With his approval, I started working on a hybrid html/flash site for the clan. He decided he liked the look of the HTML layout, and that a flash site was not suitable for dialup users. We agreed that two separate sites should be made. He would do an HTML site, and I would continue with the flash work. According to slicer, the site had to be a community based website in order for gamespy to host it, so we really couldn&#39;t make it a clan website. This presented a problem, as I was about halfway finished with the clan site. So....I put up the money to host a site and forums. I hate to say anything bad about Slicer (even though he broke up my old clan, etc, etc) but I always got the impression that he didn&#39;t approve of me hosting the website. He did not want to move all of the content over to my server, instead he wanted to link to the forums and to my version of the website. This was only the beginning of my frustrations.<br><br>Mouse had the same fixation with DEA as I, except he was more vocal about it. TM and Apoc decided to bring him into the clan without much of a vote. This pissed Joe off. He had nothing against Mouse, he was simply and understandably upset that nobody consulted with him. This is something else a lot of people never realized: Joe was DEA. Slicer may have founded the clan, but BigCountry was our leader. From the time I first started playing the game, to right before DMI split, slicer was pretty much inactive. From that point, he only played until a few months after TM and I joined. Everybody inside the clan knew that Joe called the shots, and without Joe, there was no DEA.<br><br>Eventually things calmed down, and Mouse was welcomed with open arms. The rodent brought a lot of drama to the clan. He got into quite a bit of trouble, refusing to back down from personal battles at the request of the clan. Slicer was becoming swamped with school as well, and over time became less involved with the game, yet he was still insistent on running the clan. TM and I DID NOT like this.<br><br>The match against [I] took forever to setup. We recruited Trauma shortly before the match. He had been in every clan in DX, including Immortals. Before the match we got together on the voice server and discussed our plan of attack. Trauma prepared a prayer for us. I&#39;ve never been much of a religious person, but I went along with it. The prayer ended with him asking for God&#39;s help as we declared jihad against [I]. Everybody appreciated that. I&#39;ve heard from a bunch of people that we would have lost the match without him. He had the highest score on our team for Silo, but we won that map even without him. The match opened with me killing Merlin, RatBastard, and Duke in the HE room. I think this was the peak of my skills in DX. We won silo hands down, and went on to Area51. We always believed that A51 was our second strongest map (second to silo), yet we always did poorly on it in matches. Halfway through the map, the server came under a DoS attack, and the match was unplayable. The way the map ended, [I] was above us on the scoreboard no doubt. Things ended on Cathedral, this is where the controversy is. The score (Mouse has screenshots to prove it) was DEA &gt; 100, with Immortals in the 20s. They contend that the match was over after the DoS attack, and they weren&#39;t taking it serious. There was a lot of bickering the whole time on that map, but the fact remains, we were playing while bickering. I don&#39;t know what to make of it, and frankly don&#39;t care. What really matters is that after the match, comments were made from both sides about how well Trauma played. Nobody had seen him perform like that. Merlin was convinced he was shottiming, and apoc made a comment on voice that he suspected something. Nobody realized Trauma was on there listening at the time. He left the clan. Merlin continued to say he thought something was suspicious, yet he didn&#39;t hesitate to welcome the kid back into [I] after he left us.<br><br>Time went by, and Mouse got himself into trouble. He exploited a flaw in some other clans forum and got himself admin access. It didn&#39;t take long for word to spread. Slicer didn&#39;t hesitate to kick him out of DEA. I find it ironic, after what Slicer did to DMI. Nobody was happy with Mouse, but a few of us were especially unhappy with Slicer for stepping in. At the time he had been virtually unheard from, and now suddenly he is booting members. To top it off, Slicer had mentioned that perhaps it was time to shut DEA down, because he didn&#39;t have time to run it. That sent TM and I through the roof. Joe had been running the clan by himself without Slicer for a long time, and what Joe couldn&#39;t do, we were handling ourselves. Looking back now, I think calling it quits then and there would have been the best thing for DEA. Not because I agreed with Slicer at the time, but because of everything that transpired over the following months, which could not have been predicted. TM called Slicer out in public over the whole issue, and I followed suit. The way we did it was fucked, I will admit. We insisted that Slicer hang up his hat, and so he did. PM was pissed over what we did with Slicer, him and TM got into it. He later quit the clan and went under the radar for a while.<br><br>Merlin messaged me randomly one day in his usual fashion, stating that RatBastard was throwing a beach party in LA, and we were invited. As it turns out, CannonFodder was going to be in LA that weekend for a wedding. I set sail for Merlin&#39;s house late on a Friday. We left San Jose at 3:30AM and got into LA around 8:00AM. That was a long day. A good number of DX people showed up at the party. Myself, Merlin, Rat, CannonFodder, AtomicPunk, and Rooster. I wish I still had the photos. I had a blast, but everything was sooooooooo LA. If you&#39;ve been there you know what I&#39;m talking about. I hate it.<br><br>Despite the ongoing feud between TCN and DEA, Riddler, KingLouie, TM and I managed to become friends. The two of them parted ways with TCN for reasons I cannot remember. TM and I lobbied to get them into DEA without any opposition. Having them two southerners on board was a major breath of fresh air for the clan.<br><br>Little by little, I lost interest in DX. I flat out stopped playing eventually, and stuck to managing the forums. I wanted to remain part of DEA, and wanted to contribute, so I decided to revamp the flash website project that I had never completed. I opted to start from scrach, and made the site that everybody remembers. I really had nothing to do with the game from then on.<br><br>With the exception of a couple people (Druid, Duffman, Arthur) I disagree with everybody who was brought into DEA after I stopped playing. I don&#39;t have a personal grudge with any of them, but I don&#39;t feel they were suited for the clan. A few of them dragged the DEA name through the mud, and went against everything the clan stood for. It kills me to see threads with people accusing us of cheating. Nobody in the clan was ever into that. System got his hands on that aimbot long after the clan was dead, pisses me off that he used our tag while he was doing it.<br><br>I have heard various rumors from several people over the years about bringing DEA back. I heard somebody was impersonating me and recruiting people as well. I found it flattering that somebody actually remembered me after so long, but overall I was not impressed. Let me just say this to any talk of bringing DEA back: no. There is only one person that would have the right to do so, his name is Joe.<br><br>Mouse convinced me to give RTCW a try. I found out that several of my old DMI buddies were playing it, so we clanned up and began to play competitively. We were total noobs. We started out playing OGL and STA, noob leagues for those who aren&#39;t familiar. Hitman dissapeared off the face of the earth and left me with the task of running the clan. We played season 1 of TWL and did alright. After that clan broke up, I hopped around to a couple different teams with Mouse. None of them lasted very long. Somehow I managed to land myself a spot in Vengeance, a top Cal-O team. We made it through one season of CAL and TWL, and got knocked out in the first round of playoffs. The team broke up after that, and I was solo yet again. From there Mouse got me onto a team with some really good players, right before he stopped playing the game. I knew the team was good, but didn&#39;t realize how good. That team went on to win CAL-I the following season, after which I stopped playing RTCW. A few months later System from DEA convinced me to give ET a shot. He had gotten on a top CAL-I team. I wound up hosting a server for them, and eventually playing for them. That didn&#39;t last long.<br><br>Somewhere in there Merlin had a party at his house. Hito flew up and I drove in after a night class. I proceeded to drink everybody under the table. The next day we drove into San Francisco. About one mile into the drive I was wishing I had cut back on the drinking a bit. Merlin&#39;s driving wasn&#39;t helping. I hurled out his passenger window; it was a moment to be remembered.<br><br>In January of 04 TM took a trip from New Jersey to visit me. We spent several days in San Francisco raising hell ang banging hookers. Good times were had.<br><br>In august of 04 I took two weeks off work. The first week I flew to Chicago to hang out with SilentSniper. From there it was off to New York/New Jersey to visit TM for the following week. Luck would have it, that the man himself was able to put some free time aside while I was on the east coast. We met up with BC in Brooklyn for pizza and ice cream.<br><br>DX has been the source of some close friendships for me. TM and SilentSniper are two of my closest friends. I honestly hate using video game nicknames, I think it&#39;s the gayest thing ever. I insist on being on a first name basis with my friends. I am in regular contact with the following people still:<br><br>TonyMontana<br>SilentSniper<br>System<br>Mouse<br>Strider<br>BigCountry<br>PM<br>Eagle<br>Leon (the other hitman)<br>Merlin<br><br>Occasionally Melkor comes around, same with Druid<br><br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">(in reply to question how wars were played before anti-chat patches:)<br><br></span>I guess we only played against &quot;reputable&quot; clans. There were always cheating accusations flying around but nowhere near what it became later on in the game. Matches were few and far between. In DMI we only attempted to do it once with EIS, the whole thing fell apart. While I was active in DEA we only did three. Slightly different than having two or more league matches a week, with scrimmages every night in rtcw =/ <br><br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">(in reply to Messiah noting they were left out of story:)<br></span>I&#39;ve had some good times with Merlin for sure. Now that I&#39;ve had some more time to think about it, there were a lot of people that didn&#39;t make it into the post. I didn&#39;t mention BK anywhere in there. I think we even played a match against them.<br><br>A lot of stuff towards the last six months I spent playing the game I didn&#39;t even bother to write about. I think that&#39;s when you guys really came up as a clan. I really don&#39;t remember that stuff in as great of detail as what I did write about. I know I played with and against you guys a lot, I know I spoke to you guys on msn and probably pissed a few of you off a time or two. But beyond that I really can&#39;t remember many specifics. The drama that I know about between DEA and 3 all developed when I wasn&#39;t doing much other than managing the forums. </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="677234030R30" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">31</div></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R31" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">32</div></th><td class="s4"></td><td class="s13 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:198px;left:-1px">TonyMontana</div></td><td class="s14"></td><td class="s15" dir="ltr">Veteran of DXMP, early player    (<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#ffffff;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dxalpha.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5345&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">source</a></span>)     story</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s7" dir="ltr"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R32" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">33</div></th><td></td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="s11" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 190px"><th id="677234030R33" style="height: 190px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 190px">34</div></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="s16" dir="ltr"><span style="font-style:italic;">(participating in Monoxide story:)<br></span>I can tell you without a question, that anyone caught cheating in DEA would have been banned for life on the spot.<br>To this day, even tho I am friends with him, I hate that system used a bot and our name tag. He was no longer in DEA at the time, nor was DEA still an active clan, but I still banned him from the server everytime he came on. Again, I like him and speak with him daily, but what he did made him unworthy of having ever worn the DEA tag. Id anull him ever being in the clan if I could. The only punishment I can think of for him at this point is to point out that he was never asked to be in DEA by any of the elders. He was invited by Druid who was a new memer at the time and one day he appeared with the tag and in the private forums. I am quite certain that had a vote been made that included the elders, he would not have made it in. On the flipside however I was guilty of the same with Apoc in inviting Mouse in without approval, but we did so becasue Apoc thought Mouse would kill himself in real life if we didnt let him in. He was certainly skilled but a menacing clan killer.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">(referring to System:)<br></span>I did not question your skill( even with your 1-19 showing against Triads ).<br>It is only in retrospect that I question your gaming ethics.<br>I hate cheaters and as you know to the point that I consider you all cheaters in rtcw and et for not playing with default settings.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">(continuing to add to Monoxide&#39;s story:)</span><br>To add to Craig&#39;s story, when he and I joined my goal was to re-awaken the sleeping giant that was DEA. They had all been gone for awhile and I joined with the wildest dreams of somehow making them all come back. With Craig aboard adding a 2nd active member, my dreams came true. Before I knew it I was playing along side the legends of the game, and we added Melkor. I was a tanker at the time and with the exception of Blamer, tanking wasnt the DEA MO. I wanted to play the over the top game that they had mastered. I immediately changed my power recirc to speed and began playing the speed game. Man was it a hard transition. I was easily the worst player in the clan at the time. But the style I would eventualy master, the speed tanker with vision, would live on to this day as the favorite of many of the post-DEA era&#39;s top players. Anyway, for a few months DEA was in full swing again. This should have been the last stand. The clan soon stopped playing again and it was I that begged for new recruits as I was in my prime and wanted to the DEA name to shine. I was granted limted recruiting rights and brought Druid aboard who was the person to originally get me int Deus Ex SP as I was dating his sister at the time. No one else was worthy at the time but atleast we had 6-8 active members for matches and that was good enough. We lost a couple more and thats when Druid brought a long a few more players. I think Druid should have been the last DEA and the clan should have ceased then. It was a hard thing to do tho as we had the best server and the best players, just not enough of them. Anyway thats that for now. Ill end it with this. i say this as I thought it before I was in DEA, anyone who thinks the greatest players to ever play the game were not Slicer, Apoc and BC started playing long after the game went downhill. Greatness is relative. It is quite possible that me or joe schmoe or anyone ended up being better if you could hold some weird time traveling showdown, but the relative greateness, how they mastered the game at the time they did regardless of the skill level, is unmatched. Whn messiah begged me on aim to watch him play and testify that he was not a cheater on a forum, which I did becasue i Had seen nothing special about him, Apoc had already been great, retired, been great again and retired. TCN was the last stand with the DEA greats and [3] had not even formed yet. I assure you there was no comparison and that you never saw the greatness. No none of you were there at the beggnining. No one knew a monkey or a magic man before [3] formed, by then the game had lived out its prime. You came into a world of no aug servers, and yes htere were some great players in this time such as Kale and Arthur and Hitokiri. By the legacy of the greatest game ever was already dead. Youll never have seen what 10 packed servers was like, nor what DEA greatness, which i was not a part of at the time, was like either.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="677234030R34" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">35</div></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R35" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">36</div></th><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">System[DEA]</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">Veteran of DXMP, infamous player    (<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#ffffff;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dxalpha.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5345&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">source</a></span>)     story</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s7" dir="ltr"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s4"></td></tr><tr style="height: 31px"><th id="677234030R36" style="height: 31px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 31px">37</div></th><td></td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="s11" dir="ltr"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr style="height: 190px"><th id="677234030R37" style="height: 190px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 190px">38</div></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">The infamous aimbot story is kind of funny.<br><br>This bot only turned up long after Deus Ex was long dead.

Nice score IMO. <br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">(discussing top scores, [BH]Beast sshot in particular:)<br></span>79-0 on silo.... To bad the screenshots have long since been formated. Kill scores on smuggler are NOT impressive.

I think you were already in DEA when I started playing Mono, same for TM. Think I started playing at about the time the 1112fm patch was released, but didnt really get much into the community or knew alot about it for the first few months.<br><br>I remember when DCSB was first formed. A few of us, all 56k&#39;ers. In our first few weeks we challenged DEA to a clan match, on your server, and you refused us :( I remember TM outright refusing, I believe Strider and Druid were up for it, but thats about the only 3 I really remember. TM&#39;s reasoning being he had never heard of us.<br><br>I also remember lots of time sat in Gamespy Arcade, in the DX lobby. Few of you came in there quite a bit as well.<br><br>When we moved into XMP the first thing that hit me was how different other online communities are to DX. Obviously DX was first game I ever played online so didnt know anything different. In XMP everything was done through IRC. Nobody really bothered with forums much, and msn was never really used at all either. Whereas in DX everything is forums and msn.<br><br>And same goes for clan matches as you say. In XMP we were having matches every night, in DX there just isnt any. Thing is, I dont think you can appreciate how different it is until you have been heavily into another community. Not just playing the game, but into it as a whole.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
