				<MATCH_DATE>2002-04-28</MATCH_DATE>
				<MATCH_DETAILS>A Triad victory. We agreed to play three maps but we only played two because of arguements about the maps with some &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; members. There was some lag on the &#x005B;DEA&#x005D; server when about 2-3 minutes was left of the first map. The first map was Area51Bunker and you can check the results under the "Wars" link. Second map was played on Jolt.co server because the &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; members wanted to play it there. So we changed the server and put the Silo map on. Silo was won by Triad and smuggler remained unplayed, mostly because the start of the game was delayed because KingLouie&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; and Riddler&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; were late. It was a good and very skilled game, the attitude could have been nicer though. Thank you &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; for a good match.</MATCH_DETAILS>

				<MATCH_DETAILS>The clan match was supposed to be on 1st July but we moved it to 28th June. We had a nice 3 v 3 on DarkShadows server after the &#x005B;DEA&#x005D; server crashed because of the lag. We played Area51Bunker and Smuggler. Thanks for the nice time &#x005B;DA&#x005D;!</MATCH_DETAILS>

				<MATCH_DETAILS>After searching a good server for us, we finally found one from Strider&#x005B;DEA&#x005D; (thanks). The match was challenging and fun.

				<MATCH_DATE>2002-09-15</MATCH_DATE>
				<MATCH_DETAILS>The match was supposed to start at 18 GMT but it started at 20 GMT because the server that we had, lagged really much. Luckily, Dexter&#x005B;TCNdk&#x005D; kindly let us to use the jolt.co - &#x005B;TCNdk&#x005D; server (thanks). The match started at smuggler which was filled with action. Long tanker battles and extreme fights made the game really exciting. After smuggler, we moved to cathedral. We had to wait a couple of minutes so that we would get the different team in etc. &#x005B;BK&#x005D; played 10 minutes from the cathedral map and then for some reason, they started leaving the server. Only &#x005B;BK&#x005D;Amigo stayed at the server but it was impossible to continue with 1 v 5 team...then &#x005B;BK&#x005D;Apostle informed that the match is over. It was a good game, hopefully for both clans. You can check the shots at the &apos;wars&apos; section. Thank you &#x005B;BK&#x005D; for a good match.</MATCH_DETAILS>

Good to have you with us brother, represent the tag with pride.<ADDED_CONTEXT>BK lost war to 3 previous September, then week later they merged with I.\n\n&quot;Perhaps we could say that &#x005B;I&#x005D; was losing some really important members (Arthur aka &#x005B;DK&#x005D;Bond, Dhalsim aka tRauMa / MonteCristo, VainGlory...) and at least for the little community of ours, it seemed that &#x005B;I&#x005D; was dying seriously this time. But now, Merlin came up with an idea of &#x005B;I&#x005D;mmortal and &#x005B;BK&#x005D; - BlitzKrieg merging. Apostle, the leader of &#x005B;BK&#x005D;, apparently liked the idea and suggested it to the clan. But we have heard that some of the &#x005B;I&#x005D;mmortal and &#x005B;BK&#x005D; - BlitzKrieg members have not liked the idea, at least not yet. Perhaps the most important person here is DrDeath, who found &#x005B;BK&#x005D; with Auselan (Retired). But most of the &#x005B;I&#x005D; and &#x005B;BK&#x005D; members want to merge which means that they have to discover a new clan tag and a name for their members.&quot;</ADDED_CONTEXT></MEMBERSHIP_NOTES>

Good luck in future.\n\nSERVER MESS: The server was hacked with the adminlogin by two players. One of the IPs matched closely with Sygnum aka DdM, the other one traced close to Merlin. The IP matching to Sygnum was not a surprise since the server was messed up with the adminlogin that Sygnum had due to his ex-membership to the clan. Supposedly, he decided to give out the password to Merlin to use it against us for his personal anger about something.\n\nSygnum also gave the private forum access to Merlin while being in the clan. The reason remains unknown.\n\nShame, a good friend became a two-faced enemy.</MEMBERSHIP_NOTES>

				<NEWS_TITLE>CLAN MATCH WITH &#x005B;TCN&#x005D;</NEWS_TITLE>
				<NEWS_CONTENT>A Triad victory. We agreed to play three maps but we only played two because of arguements about the maps with some &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; members. There was some lag on the &#x005B;DEA&#x005D; server when about 2-3 minutes was left of the first map. The first map was Area51Bunker and you can check the results under the "Wars" link. Second map was played on Jolt.co server because the &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; members wanted to play it there. So we changed the server and put the Silo map on. Silo was won by Triad and smuggler remained unplayed, mostly because the start of the game was delayed because KingLouie&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; and Riddler&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; were late. It was a good and very skilled game, the attitude could have been nicer though. Thank you &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; for a good match.</NEWS_CONTENT>

He played the first map in the same team with JohnnyBravo&#x005B;TCN&#x005D;. In the next map they were playing against eachother. After killing JohnnyBravo&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; with the sniper rifle &apos; other rifles, he started accusing Messíah of the FOV cheat. When he changed his name to his real name, &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; wrote a post to their forum where they stated that all of brothers of Triad are banned until Messíah publicly says that he won&apos;t enter the server. Messíah posted, correcting certain false claims and then left the clan.

				<NEWS_CONTENT>Today, in the morning, the forums of the Brotherhood of Triad were most likely hacked. All of the private forum posts were moved to the public forum so that everyone was able to read them. Luckily, not much of damage was done since the administrator closed all the forums as soon as he saw what had happened. We are trying to find out who is behind this.\n\nThere has been some other, rather odd happenings also...on saturday evening, 5th April, Messiah gained administrator abilities in the new &#x005B;I&#x005D;mmortal forums. The two main players of &#x005B;I&#x005D;mmortal, Merlin and Hitokiri, claim that they did not give administrator abilites to Messiah which means that someone else gave the administrator status to Messiah.

				<NEWS_TITLE>DXMP MARATHON @ TRIAD SERVER</NEWS_TITLE>
				<NEWS_CONTENT>Deathmatch, skill, players. The result - massacre.\n\nMany of the active DXMP players joined today to the event organized by tBoT clan, DXMP MARATHON, where the idea was to fight for the kills. The type of the game was deathmatch, which ensured that the excitement was present all the time during the marathon. Harder to hold a streak, harder to win and more challenging to everyone. But the mood was great and we&apos;re convinced everyone had their part of fun since we had ours.\n\nThe results of DXMP MARATHON can be found here.\n\nThanks to everyone who participated, it was great and we&apos;d like to do this again!\n\n~ &#x005B;tBoT&#x005D; clan ~<NEWS_CONTENT_LINK style="featured">https://web.archive.org/web/20041108031350/http://triad.deusex-online.com/deusex/marathon.htm</NEWS_CONTENT_LINK></NEWS_CONTENT>

				<NEWS_TITLE>SERVER GOING DOWN IN A MONTH</NEWS_TITLE>
				<NEWS_CONTENT>We are going to take the server down in the end of July. One of the main reasons is the low amount of players. The community has gotten smaller and smaller everyday so we can not afford to pay the server to provide a gaming place for 2 or 3 players.\n\nOur dearest apologies and we hope everyone takes the final advantage on the server before it goes down.\n\n~ The server owners</NEWS_CONTENT>

				<STORY>
					<STORY_AUTHOR style="author_clan">Clan</STORY_AUTHOR>
					<STORY_TOLD>&quot;The founders wanted to create a new clan that was unlike any others in the game and started planning Triad and its architecture in late 2001. The clan was officially established on 25th of January, 2002, when the first website and forums were also publicly launched. The name was later on changed to The Brotherhood of Triad to emphasize the fraternal unity of the clan, the equality of its members and the autocratic governing structure. The members of tBoT were to revolutionize how the game was played, being zealous pioneers who endlessly and nearly scientifically developed new strategies, methods and techniques to beat their opponents. From a new prospect tBoT quickly grew to become a semi-secret society, an elite club for the few and selected, which was to dominate the servers.&quot;</STORY_TOLD>
